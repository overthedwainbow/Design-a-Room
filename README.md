# Using Variables: The Solar System

![solar system](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/p5js/labs/solar-system.png)


## Your Task

Your task is to use the chart below to create nine spheres to create an accurate model of the solar system. The chart shows the *Diameter* of each planet in relation to Earth's diameter, and the *Distance from the Sun* of each planet in relation to Earth's distance. You should assume that the origin of the scene is the Sun (that's right, you are standing in the sun for this lab).

The numbers below are all ratios. So, for example, Venus is has a diameter that is 0.9 times as large as earth's, and is 0.7 times as far from the sun as earth. It does not matter how big you make earth, but the relative sizes of each of the other planets need to be accurate to what you create for earth. 

Assume that in the code *the ellipse that represents Earth is in the correct position and the correct size.* Place the other planets in the appropriate position with the appropriate size in relation to Earth.


## Planetary Facts - Ratio to Earth
*ratios* | MERCURY | VENUS | EARTH | MARS | JUPITER | SATURN | URANUS | NEPTUNE | PLUTO
 --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 **Diameter** | 0.4 |	0.9 |	1	| 0.5 | 11.2 | 9.5 | 4.0 | 3.9 |	0.2
 **Distance from Sun** | 0.4 | 0.7 | 1 | 1.5 |	5.2 | 9.6 |	19.2 |	30.1 |	39.5



## Additional Goals

Can you make the planets spin in place (rotate on their own axes) using an a-animation tag? 

Can you change the lighting or the background sounds (although technically space is silent, since there is no medium through which longitudinal sound waves can be transmitted)?


## Expert Challenges

If you accomplish all of these goals here are some suggestions on how you could expand on this project

Can you make the planets orbit the sun, in addition to spinning on their own axes? 

When a planet is clicked on, can you make it change texture or color? 

Could you add shooting starts in the background or an asteroid belt?

Don't stop there, these ideas are meant to be open ended to get you started thinking about all you can do with code!
